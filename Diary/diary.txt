Note: This is a diary of learnings from The Odin Project.
In this first entry on 16 July 2021, I am practicing how to write to a text file and subsequently push it to GitHub.

With this next entry, I understand that to discard changes that have not yet been committed, utilise the "git restore <file>" or "git reset --hard" for all files.
Furthermore, I learn that "git commit" still remains in my local directory. Meaning it requires a push to GitHub.
The next learning is how to append, rather than overwrite, input to a text file using double carets (vs a single caret >). 
To write to a textfile, one would use "cat > <file>" or "
"cat >> <file>".

Use date >> diary.txt to append the date to the diary!
Use echo command to echo input to the text file
to escape quotes in shell, start the sentence with a $' sign. The forward slash single quote is also an escape.

A few days has elapsed from the last practice. Knowledge of commands are no longer on my fingertips.

testing echo
use echo "<text>" >> <filename> to echo text
some Git revision. 
git remove -v to find out which folder is connected to git
git status to determine what files have not been staged
git add <filename> to stage the file
git commit -m "text" to commit the changes with a message
git log to review the commits
git add . adds all files
git push origin main to upload work to GitHub repo
git reset helps to revert changes if a file has been erroneously modified
when using "cat >> diary.txt", CTRL+D to end input.
use a hyphen as a word separator, as opposed to undercsore, as Google treats hyphen as a word separator.
a point of learning: name your folderse in lowercase, as it makes CLI navigation much easier. 
in terms of HTML, if a target file is in the same directory as the invoking html file, then use the filename directly. 
otherwise, write the directory name as part of the path with a forward slash, followed by the filename!
if the target file is in a directory above where index.html resides, then use ../

another day, another CSS

CSS is a style sheet language!
in CSS, it's important to recognise a RULESET, which comprises the SELECTOR, DECLARATION (property and value)
Curly braces, colon, and semicolons are the 3 most important symbols. 
The basic understanding uses an ELEMENT SELECTOR (i.e. p for <p>)
There are also the ID, CLASS, ATTRIBUTE, and PSEUDO-CLASS selectors!
The difference bewteen an ID and CLASS selector is that an ID selector is unique on a given HTML page, while a CLASS selector can have multiple instances.
Perhaps most interesting for now is when an element can be selected during a specific state (e.g. cursor hovering).
And obviously, there are many more selectors to learn. 
interesting to learn that <link> is for an EXTERNAL resource, such as Google Fonts. 
Although it is commonly for the CSS stylesheet in another local directory, it can also link to externally.

CSS is about the box model: padding, border, margin
The values set top, right, bottom, left
When you set two values on a property like margin or padding, the first value affects the element's top and bottom side
the second value affects the left and right side.
width, style and color 
Unsure about the differences between BLOCK and INLINE elements. Though it seems that BLOCK means taking up space (i.e. respected), while INLINE means its margin is ignored. 
 
On to JavaScript.
As opposed to <link>, which is placed between the <head>, <script> has been placed just before the closing </body> tag.
This is to due to script loading strategies. There are alternative approaches.

JavaScript is case sensitive!
There is a difference between var and let to declare variables
There are various data types like String, Number, Boolean, Array, or even Object.
Comment in JavaScript using /* and */
Or even //
learnt some javascript

started on basic CSS on FCC
a CSS class is a reusable style!
CSS fonts can "degrade"
Multiple CSS classes can be applied to a HTML element through the Class attribute, and applying a space between class names!
CSS borders have properties such as style, color and width.
border-radius property of a CSS border can be in px or % value; 50% rounds the image!
it is considered best practice for ID attributes to be unique!
ID is more important than a CLASS (higher specificity), meaning ID is applied first
Remember that ID and CLASS are known as "CSS Selectors"
To apply CSS, either STYLE, CLASS, or ID can be used. 

Remember that STYLE is applied within the respective HTML element (e.g. <p style="...">)
inline style is more important than id, and id is more important than class declarations
But more critically, there is one better way to override other CSS: !important
This is used beside the actual style to be kept (e.g. color: pink !important;)

CSS padding goes clockwise, beginning from the top (i.e. Clockwise notation)
CSS margin applies the same principle as CSS padding values^
Know that there are other CSS selectors available such as [attr=value]
There is a difference between ABSOLUTE (px/in/mm) and RELATIVE (em/rem) units of measurement
The ORDER of class declarations in the <style> section determines importance; SECOND declaration takes precedence over the first declaration!
Realise that the class ATTRIBUTE of a HTML element can contain multiple values

hex (or hexadecimal) code are base 16 numbers (vs decimals which are base 10 numbers with symbols from 0 to 9)
in hex, 0 to 9 remain, but ABCDEF continue the numbering from 10 to 15. Thus, there are 16 "numbers".
hex colors are segmented for Red, Green, and Blue (RGB)
hex codes are 6 hexadecimal digits.
Know that hex codes can be shortened (#FF0000 is the same as #F00)

colours can also be represented using rgb(0,0,0) notation.
the maximum value for R/G/B is 255
this can be remembered from hex notation where F x F is the equivalent of 16*16 = 256

a CSS variable (e.g. --penguin-skin) can be created within CSS classes.
var(--penguin-skin) can then be referenced as a CSS property value
fallbacks can be employed, so that an alternative value is used if the variable is invalid
there is a :root pseudo-class selector in CSS, which matches the root element of the document, usually HTML
CSS variables are typically declared there, as INHERITANCE means that the variable is usable globally, and accessed from any other selector in the style sheet.

browser fallbacks and compatibility
e.g. IE does not support CSS variables
to do so, one can rely on the order of precedence in CSS (i.e. browsers read CSS from top-bottom)

MEDIA QUERIES are a technique in CSS3 which introduces a rule when conditions are true
it is useful for handling differing media devices (e.g. screen size)
a BREAKPOINT, when met, will then change behaviour 
e.g. @media (max-width: 768px) { ... }

3 CSS frameworks for reset: Timothy framework, Blueprint, and Yahoo 
HTML5 semantic elements clearly describe their meaning to both the developer and browser (e.g. form, table, article, header, footer)
@import url("reset.css");  useful command to import the reset CSS sheet, which can be saved in the same folder as index.html
the purpose of a CSS RESET is to remove any unwanted styles that have been applied by the browser, in default.
A browser can have default font size and font family, for example. 
Useful website to use for resets is CSSRESET.com

rgba() is contains a field for alpha/level of opacity, which ranges from 1 to 0
box-shadow adds one or more shadows to an element
<hr> adds a horizontal line across the width of its containing element!
line-height property adjusts the spacing between lines of text
pseudo-class is added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element
BLOCK level items start on a new line, while INLINE elements sit within surrounding content (e.g. images or spans).
Think of the CSS BOX MODEL
POSITION property overrides the NORMAL flow of a document.
an ABSOLUTE position removes the element from the normal flow. 
the OFFSET properties (i.e. top, bottom, left, and right) are then used to shift the element
one other layout scheme is the FIXED position, which locks the element relative to the browser window
note that a fixed position element will not move when the user scrolls
position: absolute | relative | fixed | sticky

FLOAT is a positioning tool, which removes the element from the normal flow, and pushes the element to the LEFT or RIGHT of their containing parent element. 
float is commonly used in conjunction with width property
when elements are stacked, the Z INDEX determines how elements are ordered. 
the z index is an integer, and higher values are higher in the stack.
the DISPLAY property can be used to set an element as block or inline.

colour theory and the colour wheel
opposite colours are COMPLEMENTARY; if combined, they cancel and create a grey. but beside each other, create strong visual contrast. 
e.g. red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)
e.g. green(#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)
e.g. blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)

RGB are primary colours. 
green and blue give CYAN, as a secondary colour
red and blue give MAGENTA, as a secondary colour
red and green give YELLOW, as a secondary colour
these secondary colours are complements to the unused primary colour!

tertiary colours combine a primary colour with its secondary colour neighbour. 
e.g. red and yellow give orange
 
split-complementary color scheme starts with a base colour, then pairs it with 2 other adjacent colours to its complement.
In practice, one of the colors is usually dominant and the complement is used to bring visual attention to certain content on the page.

HSL() stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. 
hsl is an alternative way to pick a colour
hue ranges from 0 to 360, and refers to the actual coluoration
saturation of 100% is fully saturated, and refers to the amount of grey
lightness of 50% is normal (0% for black, 100% for white)
the TONE of a colour can be adjusted by playing with Saturation and Lightness
