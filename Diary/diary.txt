Note: This is a diary of learnings from The Odin Project.
In this first entry on 16 July 2021, I am practicing how to write to a text file and subsequently push it to GitHub.

With this next entry, I understand that to discard changes that have not yet been committed, utilise the "git restore <file>" or "git reset --hard" for all files.
Furthermore, I learn that "git commit" still remains in my local directory. Meaning it requires a push to GitHub.
The next learning is how to append, rather than overwrite, input to a text file using double carets (vs a single caret >). 
To write to a textfile, one would use "cat > <file>" or "
"cat >> <file>".

Use date >> diary.txt to append the date to the diary!
Use echo command to echo input to the text file
to escape quotes in shell, start the sentence with a $' sign. The forward slash single quote is also an escape.

A few days has elapsed from the last practice. Knowledge of commands are no longer on my fingertips.

testing echo
use echo "<text>" >> <filename> to echo text
some Git revision. 
git remove -v to find out which folder is connected to git
git status to determine what files have not been staged
git add <filename> to stage the file
git commit -m "text" to commit the changes with a message
git log to review the commits
git add . adds all files
git push origin main to upload work to GitHub repo
git reset helps to revert changes if a file has been erroneously modified
when using "cat >> diary.txt", CTRL+D to end input.
use a hyphen as a word separator, as opposed to undercsore, as Google treats hyphen as a word separator.
a point of learning: name your folderse in lowercase, as it makes CLI navigation much easier. 
in terms of HTML, if a target file is in the same directory as the invoking html file, then use the filename directly. 
otherwise, write the directory name as part of the path with a forward slash, followed by the filename!
if the target file is in a directory above where index.html resides, then use ../

put together a basic html page

another day, another CSS

CSS is a style sheet language!
in CSS, it's important to recognise a RULESET, which comprises the SELECTOR, DECLARATION (property and value)
Curly braces, colon, and semicolons are the 3 most important symbols. 
The basic understanding uses an ELEMENT SELECTOR (i.e. p for <p>)
There are also the ID, CLASS, ATTRIBUTE, and PSEUDO-CLASS selectors!
The difference bewteen an ID and CLASS selector is that an ID selector is unique on a given HTML page, while a CLASS selector can have multiple instances.
Perhaps most interesting for now is when an element can be selected during a specific state (e.g. cursor hovering).
And obviously, there are many more selectors to learn. 
interesting to learn that <link> is for an EXTERNAL resource, such as Google Fonts. 
Although it is commonly for the CSS stylesheet in another local directory, it can also link to externally.

CSS is about the box model: padding, border, margin
The values set top, right, bottom, left
When you set two values on a property like margin or padding, the first value affects the element's top and bottom side
the second value affects the left and right side.
width, style and color 
Unsure about the differences between BLOCK and INLINE elements. Though it seems that BLOCK means taking up space (i.e. respected), while INLINE means its margin is ignored. 
 
On to JavaScript.
As opposed to <link>, which is placed between the <head>, <script> has been placed just before the closing </body> tag.
This is to due to script loading strategies. There are alternative approaches.
