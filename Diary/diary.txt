Note: This is a diary of learnings from The Odin Project.
In this first entry on 16 July 2021, I am practicing how to write to a text file and subsequently push it to GitHub.

With this next entry, I understand that to discard changes that have not yet been committed, utilise the "git restore <file>" or "git reset --hard" for all files.
Furthermore, I learn that "git commit" still remains in my local directory. Meaning it requires a push to GitHub.
The next learning is how to append, rather than overwrite, input to a text file using double carets (vs a single caret >). 
To write to a textfile, one would use "cat > <file>" or "
"cat >> <file>".

Use date >> diary.txt to append the date to the diary!
Use echo command to echo input to the text file
to escape quotes in shell, start the sentence with a $' sign. The forward slash single quote is also an escape.

A few days has elapsed from the last practice. Knowledge of commands are no longer on my fingertips.

testing echo
use echo "<text>" >> <filename> to echo text
some Git revision. 
git remove -v to find out which folder is connected to git
git status to determine what files have not been staged
git add <filename> to stage the file
git commit -m "text" to commit the changes with a message
git log to review the commits
git add . adds all files
git push origin main to upload work to GitHub repo
git reset helps to revert changes if a file has been erroneously modified
when using "cat >> diary.txt", CTRL+D to end input.
use a hyphen as a word separator, as opposed to undercsore, as Google treats hyphen as a word separator.
a point of learning: name your folderse in lowercase, as it makes CLI navigation much easier. 
in terms of HTML, if a target file is in the same directory as the invoking html file, then use the filename directly. 
otherwise, write the directory name as part of the path with a forward slash, followed by the filename!
if the target file is in a directory above where index.html resides, then use ../
