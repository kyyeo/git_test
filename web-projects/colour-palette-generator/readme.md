What did I learn with this mini-project?
(1) Through JS, it's possible to change the CLASS selector of HTML elements. For example, on click.
(2) I am able to debug reasonably. For example, the red outline upon copying. 
(3) Through The Odin Project, I have a basic understanding of the interactions between HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
(4) While Tyler codes and previews in Chrome, the Firefox seems to display slightly differently. For example, the default padding in Chrome can be 0, but Firefox needs a minimum of 10px from the top and left. 
(5) There is a live-server in VSCode, which reflects code changes immediately.
(6) There is CoPilot by Github, which I could not use due to VirtualBox, but it assists in coding by predicting code blocks.
